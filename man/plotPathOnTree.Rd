\title{Build the image object of the whole tree with the path superimposed onto it}
\usage{
plotPathOnTree(path, tree, ig, binVector = sample(1:12, 12))
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{path as returned from getPath() or a vector
  of two variety names which exist in ig}

  \item{tree}{the data tree (in data frame format)}

  \item{ig}{the graph representation of the data tree (in
  igraph format)}

  \item{binVector}{vector of numbers between 1 and
  length(binVector), each repeated exactly once}
}
\description{
This function requires a path and the ig object, and plots
the entire tree with the path highlighted. The image will
correctly position the node labels with x-axis representing
the node year, and y-axis representing the node path index.
Light grey edges between two nodes represent parent-child
relationships between those nodes. To enhance the visual
understanding of how the path-of-interest fits into the
entire graph structure, the nodes within the path are
labelled in boldface, and connected with light-green
boldfaced edges.
